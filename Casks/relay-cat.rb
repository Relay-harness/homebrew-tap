  caveats <<~EOS
    This preview is ad-hoc signed, not Apple-notarized. Homebrew does not
    make it Apple-verified and keeps macOS quarantine protection enabled.
    If macOS blocks the first launch, review the source and checksum first.
    Only if you trust this build: try opening Miso, then use System Settings
    > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway and confirm the macOS prompt.
    Do not bypass a warning that says the app contains malware or will
    damage your computer. Do not disable Gatekeeper system-wide.

    When you enable live quotas, Miso also shares rounded usage percentages
    with throttleindex.com. Turn it off in Data permissions.
